        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Khichdi is a simple, classic Indian dish made with rice and yellow mung lentils. It is actually a very healthy recipe — so much so that in India, when someone is ill or recovering from illness, Dalia and Moong Dal Khichdi are often served.

            .</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
        <ul>
            <li>Lentils: I used a half cup of split and husked moong dal, but you can use red lentils (masoor dal) or pigeon pea lentils (tur dal) instead. Keep in mind that while using other lentils, the cooking time will vary and change and you may need to add more water.</li>
            <li>Rice: You can use any type of non-sticky rice for this recipe — regular, short, or medium-grained rice or even basmati.</li>    
            <li>Veggies: You will need onion, tomato, all finely chopped.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: I always end up adding adding green chillies, ginger, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, asafoetida (hing), and salt.</li>
            <li>Butter for serving</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
