        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Parathas are simple flatbreads that are made with whole wheat (or atta) flour and just a few other simple ingredients. A soft dough is prepared by hand, formed and flattened, and then folded several times to create lots of flaky layers. They are then roasted to perfection 
            and served warm with a variety of Indian dishes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cup Wheat Flour(for dough)+1/2 cup 
                for rolling</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Oil + for shallow frying</li>    
            <li> 1/2 cup Water (or as needed)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Butter for serving</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix 1¼ cup wheat flour, 1 teaspoon oil and salt in a medium size bowl to prepare a dough. </li>
            <li>Add water in small incremental quantity (1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, total approx. 1/2 cup but change it as required) and knead the smooth and soft dough like chapati dough. Grease its surface with 1 teaspoon oil and cover it. Keep it aside for 10 minutes to let it settle at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Divide it into 6 equal parts and give each part a round shape (like small ball). Take one dough ball, flatten it like pattie by pressing it between your palms or against roti making board. Take 1/2 cup dry wheat flour in a plate. Coat the pattie with dry wheat flour (dry flour coating will prevent it from sticking to rolling pin and board)</li>
            <li>Put dough pattie on roti making board (chakla) and roll it out like very thick small roti using rolling pin (circle of approx. 4-5 inch diameter).</li>
            <li>Spread few drops of oil and dust flour on top surface and fold it into half-circle. Again, spread few drops of oil and dust flour on it and again fold into a triangle shaped layered pattie.
            </li>
            <li>Coat it with dry flour and roll it out into triangle paratha having approx 6 inch long sides. Also, it should be thicker than phulka roti but thinner than tandoori roti/naan.
            </li>
            <li>Place it on a hot tava/griddle and cook over medium flame. When tiny bubbles start to rise on the surface, flip it and reduce flame to low.
            </li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 teaspoon oil evenly on the surface and cook on low flame for approx 30-40 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>Flip it again and spread 1/2 teaspoon oil evenly on another side. Press it with spatula and cook over medium flame for 30-40 seconds. Repeat flip-press-cook process until golden brown spots appear on both sides. (do not spread oil in subsequent flip-press-cook process. Based on the size of gas burner you have, it may be required to flip 1 to 3 times to cook properly. You should look out for evenly spread golden brown spots on both sides to determine if it’s cooked or not.)
            </li>
            <li>Take it away from heat and transfer to a plate. Spread butter as per your liking. Follow the same process for remaining dough balls. Serve it with curd and pickle or with any indian cuisine.</li>
